### Design pattern 
1. Strategy v.s. Decorator  

	Suppose the final object is a person who has different clothes.  

	Decorator is like adding clothes to a human body. The human body in Decorator does't know his clothes.  

	Strategy is like a person selects his clothes. Strategy is a person who owns all his clothes.
